# Tomcat Cookbook

## Description

A super simple **and incomplete** cookbook that:

 - Installs Tomcat from binary tarball
 - Configures an init script
 - Configures setenv.sh
 - Enables and starts Tomcat service

The purpose of this - for now - is to address the simple fact that the more popular Tomcat cookbooks don't quite do what I need them to do and/or are too complex for my needs.  I'm sure my cookbook will get there as feature requests come in, but we'll jump off that bridge when we get to it.

## Requirements

 - CentOS
 - Chef 11
 - Ark cookbook
 - Java cookbook

## Usage

### Tomcat 7 with OpenJDK 6
```ruby
# recipe space
include_recipe 'tomcat::default'
```

### Tomcat 5.5 with OpenJDK 6
```ruby
# attribute space
include_attribute 'tomcat'
node[:tomcat][:version] = '55'

# recipe space
include_recipe 'tomcat::default'
```
